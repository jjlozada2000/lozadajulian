A new personal resume website!  But like, one that is actually good and WILL be attached to my resume/profiles.

I am the only developer for this website, utilizing components of AI to speed up the process to learn how to better prompt AI tools such as Claude.
Although, I am using my experience from coding my Senior Project and showcasing it here. The Senior Project is another repository I am part of, called SEAtech.

The Full Stack:
  Frontend:
      React + Vite
      TypeScript
      CSS
  Backend:
      Java Spring Boot
  Database:
      PostgreSQL
